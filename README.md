# PrimeReact Theming with SASS

Visit the [official documentation](https://primereact.org/theming/#customtheme) for more information.

# About the fork

[As per instructions here](https://primereact.org/theming/#customtheme), we must copy the contents from `mytheme` to our projects. This approach would cut the updates to the saas theme.
We choose to fork the repo, and apply our brand colors. This way when there's an update we will merge latest changes in our theme (in this repository).

# How to tweak the variables

1. Change the variables from `mytheme`
2. run the `saas` command to compile the `theme.css` (more details in above links)
3. copy the resulting `theme.css` in `fabled-kit`
